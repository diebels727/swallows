1. can the swallow fly in one direction? (e.g. toward the destination)
  is this a valid flight path:
    10
    0 2 1
    1 4 1

  with optimal path being:  0->2->1->4
  and an optimal cost of: 22

2. will this program be subject to a test suite (that I do not write)?  if so, is there a specific interface that the program should conform to?
